# Simulation-of-Keller-Segel-diffusion-model-using-orward-Finite-Difference
I implemented a Keller-Segel diffusion model and Forward Finite Difference method in Mathematica to model the effect of hydrogen peroxide preconditioning on stem cell migration. The lab work was supported by the Center for Stem Cell Excellence at Zewail City.
